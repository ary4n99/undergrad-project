\noindent Deep reinforcement learning is a rapidly growing field in machine learning, with development in the space taking off since the introduction of the TD Gammon
algorithm. The current focus of research is improving the generalization capabilities of the algorithms.

The aim of the project is to reduce training time and improve model performance
specifically in OpenAI Gym's Mountain Car and Car Racing environments, compared
to benchmark figures; we use the popular value based and hybrid model-free deep
reinforcement learning techniques, deep Q-learning and advantage actor-critic
respectively. An additional goal is to implement a graphical user interface for
visualizing model performance and changes in the neural network as training
progresses. The idea behind this visualization is to provide an enhanced
understanding of the reason for the network's performance, to aid in tuning
the training hyperparameters.

Environment specific optimizations to the algorithms are the focus of
exploration in this project. We achieve over 9\% improvement in the score for
Mountain Car and over 86\% improvement in the score for Car Racing compared to
vanilla approaches, within only 500 training episodes for three out of the four
agents.
